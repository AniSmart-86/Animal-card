                    <p> Because of their strength, eagles have been a symbol of war and 
                        imperial power since Babylonian times.
                        Their likeness is found on Greek and Roman ruins, coins,
                         and medals....</p>

                    <p> Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers.
                         Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures</p>
